# JS8Call
JS8Call is an experiment in combining the robustness of FT8 (a weak-signal mode by K1JT) with a messaging and network protocol layer for weak signal communication. The open source software is designed for connecting amateur radio operators who are operating under weak signal conditions and offers real-time keyboard-to-keyboard messaging, store-and-forward messaging, and automatic station announcements.

# JS8Call-improved
JS8Call-improved aims to be upstream development HEAD for the JS8Call project. Most of the same developers work on both projects. With JS8Call-improved we are able to implement bug fixes and features must faster so development can proceed at a faster pace. It is likely that bug fixes and/or features in JS8Call-improved may not be incorporated into the official JS8Call project.
