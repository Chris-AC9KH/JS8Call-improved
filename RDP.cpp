// We'll typically end up with a ton of points to draw for the spectrum,
// and some simplification is worthwhile; use the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker
// algorithm to reduce to a smaller number of points.
//
// We'll modify the inbound polygon in place, such that anything we want
// to keep is at the start of the polygon and anything we want to omit
// is at the end, returning an iterator to the new end, i.e., the point
// one past the last point we want to keep.
//
// Our goal here is to avoid reallocations. Since we're at worst going to
// be leaving this the same size, we should be able to work with what we
// have already.
//
// Note that this is a functor; it's serially reusable, but not reentrant.
// Call it from one thread only. In practical use, that's not expected to
// be a problem, and it allows us to reuse allocated memory in a serial
// manner, rather than requesting it and freeing it constantly.
